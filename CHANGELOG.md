# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Total balance calculation**: Fixed `getAccounts()` total balance calculation to properly subtract debt from assets instead of adding all balances as positive values. This resolves inflated balance calculations for users with loans, mortgages, and credit cards.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **`get_holdings` tool**: Current investment positions with ticker, name, quantity, price, average cost, and total return per holding
- **`get_investment_prices` tool**: Historical price data (daily + high-frequency) for stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and crypto
- **`get_investment_splits` tool**: Stock split history with ratios, dates, and multipliers
- Database accessors for securities and holdings history collections
- Full decode coverage for all 35 Firestore collection paths (securities, balance_history, holdings_history, investment_performance, tags, amazon, changes, user profile, app metadata)

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 9 to 12
- Ticker symbol filters are now case-insensitive across all investment tools

### Fixed
- Date range filter now correctly handles daily prices that use month format (`p.month` fallback)
- Division guard prevents `Infinity` when holding quantity is zero

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Decode timeout**: Made decode timeout configurable via `--timeout` CLI flag, with a sensible default of 90 seconds
- Threaded timeout config through the stack instead of using environment variables
- Prevented promise hang when decode worker exits without sending a result

### Changed
- CI: Skip AI code review on Dependabot and forked PRs

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **`get_connection_status` tool**: Check bank sync/connection health status for linked accounts

### Fixed
- Corrected `package.json` main field to `dist/server.js`
- Isolated LevelDB decoding in worker thread to prevent memory leaks
- Used `transaction_id` for dedup and reconcile pending/posted transaction pairs

### Changed
- Excluded dev artifacts and internal docs from `.mcpb` bundle
- Removed legacy Python config files (`.coveragerc`, `pytest.ini`)
- Cleaned up Python-specific entries from `.gitignore`

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Cursor/Electron compatibility**: Fixed native module loading error in Cursor and other Electron-based editors
  - Added dual distribution strategy: bundled build for Claude Desktop (.mcpb), external native modules for npm
  - Resolves "No native build was found for platform=darwin arch=arm64 runtime=electron abi=141" error

### Changed
- Build scripts now use separate targets for npm (`build`) and .mcpb (`build:mcpb`)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- Filter out budgets with orphaned category references from `get_budgets` results
- Prevents raw Firestore IDs (like `rXFkilafMIseI6OMZ6ze`) from leaking through as `category_name`
- Added `isKnownPlaidCategory()` helper function to validate category IDs

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **5-minute cache TTL**: Database automatically refreshes after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **`refresh_database` tool**: Force refresh the database cache on demand
- **`get_cache_info` tool**: View cache status and database statistics
- **Name filter for `get_recurring_transactions`**: Filter recurring items by name pattern
- **Detail view for `get_recurring_transactions`**: Get full transaction history for a specific recurring item
- **Date filtering for `get_categories`**: Filter categories by date range to match UI behavior

### Changed
- Improved transaction history resolution with fallback search

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

#### New Data Quality Tool
- **`get_data_quality_report`** - Comprehensive data quality analysis tool
  - Detects unresolved category IDs that can't be mapped to human-readable names
  - Flags potential currency conversion issues (large amounts with foreign merchant names)
  - Identifies non-unique transaction IDs (multiple transactions sharing same ID)
  - Finds potential duplicate accounts (same name and type)
  - Detects suspicious categorizations (e.g., Uber as Parking, pharmacies as Office Supplies)
  - Provides actionable insights for users to fix data in Copilot Money

#### Enhanced Analysis Capabilities
- **Improved Income Detection**
  - Now excludes transfer categories and credit card payments automatically
  - Filters out internal transfers by merchant name patterns (CREDIT CARD, AUTOPAY, etc.)
  - Excludes likely refunds from common merchants (Amazon, Uber, Target, etc. under $500)
  - Better distinction between true income and credits/refunds
  - More accurate income reporting for financial analysis

- **Enhanced Foreign Transaction Detection**
  - Parses merchant names for foreign city indicators (Santiago, London, Paris, Tokyo, etc.)
  - Detects country codes in merchant names (CL, GB, MX, FR, DE, IT, ES, JP, CA)
  - Checks region field for non-US state codes
  - More comprehensive international transaction identification
  - Catches transactions that were previously missed

- **Better Trip Location Detection**
  - Extracts city names from merchant names when not in transaction fields
  - Infers country codes from merchant data patterns
  - Displays multiple cities visited during a trip
  - Handles missing location data gracefully with intelligent fallbacks
  - Trips now show actual locations instead of "Unknown"

### Changed
- **Major Tool Consolidation**: Reduced from 60 tools to 28 using parameter-driven design
  - `get_spending` now uses `group_by` parameter (category, merchant, day_of_week, time_period)
  - `get_budget_analytics` consolidates budget utilization, vs_actual, recommendations, alerts
  - `get_goal_analytics` consolidates goal progress, at_risk, recommendations
  - `get_investment_analytics` consolidates performance, dividends, fees analysis
  - `get_account_analytics` consolidates activity, balance_trends, fees
  - `get_merchant_analytics` consolidates top merchants, frequency, spending analysis
- Test count increased to 624 tests (from 366)
- Assertion count increased to 2110+ (from 1360+)
- All tests passing with enhanced coverage

### Technical Details
- **Design Philosophy**: Data quality issues are surfaced rather than masked, enabling users to fix root causes in Copilot Money
- **Backwards Compatible**: All changes are additive, no breaking changes
- **Performance**: No impact on query performance
- **Testing**: All new functionality comprehensively tested
