2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file to install in Claude Desktop
3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. Start asking questions about your finances!

### Installation via npm

```bash
npm install -g copilot-money-mcp
```

Then add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-money": {
      "command": "copilot-money-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Installation for Cursor

1. Install the package globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g copilot-money-mcp
   ```

2. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd + ,`)

3. Search for "MCP" or go to **Features > MCP Servers**

4. Add the server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "copilot-money": {
         "command": "copilot-money-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Done

### Manual Installation for Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ignaciohermosillacornejo/copilot-money-mcp.git
cd copilot-money-mcp

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build

# Run tests
bun test
```

## First-Time Setup

After installing the MCP server, Claude Desktop will request **one-time approval for each tool** when you first use them. This is a standard security feature for all MCP servers.

**What to expect:**
- You'll see approval prompts as you use different tools
- Each prompt shows the tool name and what it does
- After approving once, the tools work seamlessly without further prompts

**Why this happens:**
- Claude Desktop requires explicit user consent before an MCP tool can access your data
- Even though all our tools are read-only (with `readOnlyHint: true`), Claude Desktop shows these prompts as a security best practice
- This is normal behavior and not specific to this MCP server

**After first use:** Once you've approved all tools, they'll work instantly without any prompts in future conversations!

## Working Examples

### Example 1: Monthly Spending Analysis

**User Query:**
> "How much did I spend on dining out last month?"

**MCP Tool Call:**
```json
{
  "tool": "get_transactions",
  "arguments": {
    "category": "food_and_drink",
    "period": "last_month"
  }
}
```

**Claude's Answer:**
> "Last month you spent $487.50 on dining out across 23 transactions. Your largest expense was $67.50 at The Italian Place on January 15th."

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides **8 read-only tools** for querying your financial data:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_transactions` | Query transactions with filters (date, category, merchant, amount, account, location). Supports period shortcuts, text search, and special types (foreign, refunds, duplicates). |
| `get_accounts` | List all accounts with balances, optionally filter by type (checking, savings, credit, investment). |
| `get_categories` | List all transaction categories with human-readable names, transaction counts, and spending totals. Filter by date range. |
| `get_recurring_transactions` | Identify subscriptions and recurring charges with frequency, monthly cost, and next expected date. Filter by name for detailed view. |
| `get_budgets` | Get budgets from Copilot's native budget tracking with spending vs. limit comparisons. |
| `get_goals` | Get financial goals with progress tracking, monthly history, and savings status. |
| `get_cache_info` | Get information about the local data cache, including date range and transaction count. |
| `refresh_database` | Refresh the in-memory cache to pick up newly synced data from Copilot Money. Cache auto-refreshes every 5 minutes. |

### Architecture

**Data Flow:**
1. Copilot Money stores data in local LevelDB/Firestore cache
2. Binary decoder reads `.ldb` files and parses Protocol Buffers
3. Database layer provides filtered access to transactions/accounts
4. MCP tools expose functionality via Model Context Protocol
5. Claude Desktop sends queries → MCP server responds

**Technical Stack:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+ (ESM modules)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.3+
- **Validation:** Zod schemas
- **Database:** LevelDB (classic-level) + Protocol Buffers
- **Testing:** Bun test runner (772 tests, 100% passing)
- **MCP SDK:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.2

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Watch mode
bun test --watch

# Run specific test file
bun test tests/tools/tools.test.ts
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ 772 tests passing
- ✅ 1920+ assertions

## Data Privacy & Security

**Read our full [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md)**

Key commitments:
- **No Data Transmission:** Zero network requests, all processing local
- **Read-Only Access:** Never modifies your Copilot Money database
- **No Telemetry:** No analytics, crash reports, or tracking
- **Open Source:** Verify privacy claims by reviewing the code
- **macOS Sandbox:** Respects macOS file system permissions

## Supported Date Periods

The `period` parameter supports these shortcuts:
- `this_month` - Current month (Jan 1 - today if in January)
- `last_month` - Previous calendar month
- `last_7_days` - Rolling 7-day window
- `last_30_days` - Rolling 30-day window
- `last_90_days` - Rolling 90-day window
- `ytd` - Year-to-date (Jan 1 - today)
- `this_year` - Current calendar year
- `last_year` - Previous calendar year

## Configuration

### Cache TTL

The MCP server caches data in memory for 5 minutes by default. You can configure this via environment variable:

```bash
# Set cache TTL to 10 minutes
COPILOT_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=10 copilot-money-mcp

# Disable caching (always reload from disk)
COPILOT_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=0 copilot-money-mcp
```

You can also manually refresh the cache using the `refresh_database` tool.

### Decode Timeout

For large databases (500MB+), you may need to increase the decode timeout. The default is 5 minutes (300,000ms).

**Via environment variable:**
```bash
DECODE_TIMEOUT_MS=600000 copilot-money-mcp
```

**Via CLI flag:**
```bash
copilot-money-mcp --timeout 600000
```

**In Claude Desktop config** (with increased Node.js memory for 1GB+ databases):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-money": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "--max-old-space-size=4096",
        "/path/to/copilot-money-mcp/dist/cli.js",
        "--db-path",
        "/path/to/your/database",
        "--timeout",
        "600000"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Known Limitations

### Local Cache Size

This MCP server reads from Copilot Money's **local Firestore cache**, not directly from the cloud. The cache typically contains:
- **~500 recent transactions** (not your full history)
- Accounts, budgets, goals, and recurring transactions
- Data synced during recent app usage

**Why this limitation exists:** Copilot Money uses Firebase/Firestore with App Check security, which prevents direct cloud database access. The local cache is an offline copy maintained by the app for performance.

**To maximize cached data:**
1. Open the Copilot Money app regularly
2. Scroll through your transaction history to trigger sync
3. The cache updates when you interact with the app

**What you get:** While you may have thousands of transactions in Copilot Money, only recently accessed/synced data is available locally. This is sufficient for most queries (recent spending, current budgets, recurring charges) but won't include your complete historical data.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Not Found

If you see "Database not available":
1. Ensure Copilot Money is installed and has synced data
2. Check database location: `~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application Support/firestore/__FIRAPP_DEFAULT/copilot-production-22904/main`
3. Verify `.ldb` files exist in the directory
4. Provide custom path: `copilot-money-mcp --db-path /path/to/database`

### Decode Worker Timed Out (Large Databases)

If you see `Decode worker timed out after 300000ms`:
1. Your database may be too large for the default 5-minute timeout
2. Increase the timeout: `copilot-money-mcp --timeout 600000` (10 minutes)
3. For databases over 1GB, also increase Node.js memory: `node --max-old-space-size=4096 dist/cli.js --timeout 600000`
4. Set via environment variable: `DECODE_TIMEOUT_MS=600000`

### No Transactions Found

- Copilot Money may not have synced yet - open the app and wait for sync
- The database structure may have changed - open an issue with details
