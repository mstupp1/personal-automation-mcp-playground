## Disclaimer

**This is an independent, community-driven project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Copilot Money or its parent company in any way.** This tool was created by an independent developer to enable AI-powered queries of locally cached data. "Copilot Money" is a trademark of its respective owner.

## Overview

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives AI assistants access to your Copilot Money personal finance data. It reads from the locally cached Firestore database (LevelDB + Protocol Buffers) on your Mac. **Reads are 100% local with zero network requests.** Optional write mode (opt-in via `--write`) sends your requested changes directly to Copilot Money's Firebase/Firestore backend — the same backend the Copilot Money app itself uses — authenticated with your own credentials, never through any third-party service.

**35 tools** across spending, investments, budgets, goals, and more:

- **17 read tools** — query transactions, accounts, holdings, balances, categories, recurring charges, budgets, goals, investment performance, and more
- **18 write tools** (opt-in) — consolidate transaction changes, manage tags, create budgets, update recurring items, and organize your finances

**Read-only by default.** Write tools require explicitly starting the server with `--write` to enable.

## Privacy First

We never collect, store, or transmit your data to any server operated by this project — we don't have any. See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for details.

- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind
- Reads are fully local — zero network requests
- Read-only by default (write tools disabled unless you pass `--write`)
- In opt-in write mode, requests go directly from your machine to Copilot Money's own Firebase/Firestore backend using your own credentials — never through any third-party service
- Open source — verify the code yourself

| **Tags** | `create_tag`, `update_tag`, `delete_tag` |

## Write Mode

By default, the server starts in **read-only mode**. To enable write tools, start the server with the `--write` flag:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-money": {
      "command": "copilot-money-mcp",
      "args": ["--write"]
    }
  }
}
```

Write tools modify your Copilot Money data by sending authenticated requests directly to Copilot Money's Firebase/Firestore backend — the same backend the Copilot Money app uses — so your changes are immediately reflected in your account. Writes authenticate using a Firebase refresh token extracted from your local Copilot Money session; your credentials never leave your machine except in the authenticated request to Google's Firebase/Firestore endpoints. No third-party services are involved. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for full details.

## Configuration

### Telegram MCP Wrapper for Codex

This repo includes [`scripts/mcp-telegram-wrapper.mjs`](scripts/mcp-telegram-wrapper.mjs) as a local compatibility wrapper for `@iqai/mcp-telegram` when used from Codex.

The upstream package was not designed for Codex's MCP expectations. In practice it writes normal logs to `stdout`, which interferes with stdio transport, so Codex cannot reliably handshake with it directly. This wrapper runs as a small first-party MCP server using the official MCP SDK and calls the Telegram Bot API directly.

Set these environment variables in your Codex MCP config:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: required bot token
- `TELEGRAM_DEFAULT_CHAT_ID`: optional default destination for personal messages

When `TELEGRAM_DEFAULT_CHAT_ID` is configured, `SEND_MESSAGE` can omit `chatId` and will default to that chat automatically.

This is a local integration workaround for this project. It does not change Copilot Money MCP behavior and it is not a forked upstream release.

### Cache TTL

The server caches data in memory for 5 minutes. Configure via environment variable:

```bash
# Set cache TTL to 10 minutes
COPILOT_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=10 copilot-money-mcp

# Disable caching (always reload from disk)
COPILOT_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=0 copilot-money-mcp
```

You can also refresh manually using the `refresh_database` tool.

### Decode Timeout

For large databases (500MB+), increase the decode timeout (default: 90 seconds):

```bash
# Via environment variable
DECODE_TIMEOUT_MS=600000 copilot-money-mcp

# Via CLI flag
copilot-money-mcp --timeout 600000
```

For databases over 1GB, also increase Node.js memory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "copilot-money": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "--max-old-space-size=4096",
        "/path/to/copilot-money-mcp/dist/cli.js",
        "--timeout", "600000"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported Date Periods

The `period` parameter supports these shortcuts:

`this_month` `last_month` `last_7_days` `last_30_days` `last_90_days` `ytd` `this_year` `last_year`

## Known Limitations

### Local Cache Dependency

This server reads from Copilot Money's **local Firestore cache**, not the cloud. Firestore's offline persistence caches every document the app has ever fetched, so the local database generally contains all transactions, accounts, budgets, goals, and other data you've viewed in the app. The default Firestore cache size is 100 MB (enough for tens of thousands of transactions), and older documents are only evicted via LRU garbage collection if that limit is exceeded.

**To maximize cached data:** Open the Copilot Money app and browse through your data (transaction history, accounts, budgets) to ensure it has been fetched and cached locally.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Not Found

If you see "Database not available":
1. Ensure Copilot Money is installed and has synced data
2. Check the database location: `~/Library/Containers/com.copilot.production/Data/Library/Application Support/firestore/__FIRAPP_DEFAULT/copilot-production-22904/main`
3. Verify `.ldb` files exist in the directory
4. Provide a custom path: `copilot-money-mcp --db-path /path/to/database`

### Decode Worker Timed Out

If you see "Decode worker timed out":
1. Increase the timeout: `copilot-money-mcp --timeout 300000` (5 minutes)
2. For 1GB+ databases, also increase Node.js memory: `node --max-old-space-size=4096 dist/cli.js --timeout 300000`

### No Transactions Found

- Open the Copilot Money app and wait for sync
- The database structure may have changed — [open an issue](https://github.com/ignaciohermosillacornejo/copilot-money-mcp/issues)
